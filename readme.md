# Using Javascript for Text-to-Speech

In this simple application, I used **Vanilla Javascript (JS)** and the **Web Speech API** to read text content in an **HTML** textarea and then I have buttons like speed, play, pause and stop to control the text-to-speech.

In future, I will include a CSS framework to style the application and probably come up with an electron version of the application.
